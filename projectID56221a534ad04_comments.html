<HTML><BODY>A 1911 book on the Folk-lore in West and Mid-Wales.

<p>A few times, the page may be a bit hard to read. Two sets of scans for this book are available at the internet archive (copy <a href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924029911298">1</a>, used to prepare this project, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/folkloreofwestmi00daviuoft">2</a>).

<p>Have fun!</BODY></HTML>
